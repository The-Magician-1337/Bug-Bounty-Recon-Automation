Summary: Developed a bash script to streamline bug bounty processes. The tool automates subdomain discovery (active and
 passive), generates permutations, and conducts HTTP probing with httpx. It leverages Wayback Machine data for endpoint
 discovery, extracts parameters using the GF tool, performs vulnerability scanning with Nuclei, and conducts port scanning for open
 services. This tool has enhanced efficiency in identifying potential vulnerabilities, streamlining reconnaissance, and expanding the
 scope of security testing.
